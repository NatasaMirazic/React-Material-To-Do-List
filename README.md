# React-Material-To-Do-List

## Description

To-Do list is created as an internal project for my portfolio. 
This project allows you to make your To-Do list with tasks. To-Do list contains two tabs:
1. To-Do - a list of tasks that arenâ€™t done. Every new task is in the To-Do tab by default. Tasks in this tab can be marked as done by checking, but also can be deleted.
2. Done - List of done items. Tasks in this tab can be restored to the To-Do tab and also can be deleted.
In both tabs, we can sort tasks with drag and drop. All tasks are saved in local storage, so if you refresh the page, all your tasks will be saved in the browser.
